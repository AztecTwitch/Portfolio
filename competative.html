    <h2>Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege Esports</h2>
    <p>It's a tactical, team based first person shooter. I started playing daily in 2016, learning, improving, it was something so different from what I knew from CS:GO. It was multiple maps each a multi storey building, rooms, sites all with their own callouts, different operators all with a unique loadout, gadgets, abilities. I picked up Siege during Operation Skull Rain, Year 1 Season 3 and the game is currently in Year 7 Season 4 just for comparison. <br>
      I played this game daily after purchasing, climbing the ranks, making new friends throughout the years, then in 2019 they announced CCS Women’s League as an all women's tournament. 
      During this time I was only playing the game with one other girl from the EU and we decided to make our own team and enter this tournament, reaching out on Twitter for people to come tryout for us, eventually we picked out our team and before the tournament started we got signed by T3H Esports, sadly that Esports organisation disbanded. <br>
      We didn't have to wait long before TeamEndpoint showed interest in us and signed us under contract. We eventually came 3rd place in the tournament. Continuing with TeamEndpoint we grew as a team, improving, playing more small tournaments and even winning some of them but sadly, my contract with TeamEndpoint ended in 2020. <br>
      After this I played multiple tournaments, leagues and some qualifiers under contract with a few other Esports teams until I announced I would be taking a break from competitive after being unsuccessful in qualifying for CCS Women’s League 2021.
      </p>

  <h2>Tournaments</h2>
  <p>During my competitive career I have played in multiple tournaments,
    the main one being CCS R6 Womens in 2019, this was my first big tournament and after a few months of training my team (TeamEndpoint) came 3rd.
    After this I played in Rainbow Six Female in 2019 & 2020 my team (TeamEndpoint) got 1st place for both tournaments . More well known tournament in the UK
    that I've entered are ESL Challenger League Qualifiers, UKIN Division Qualifiers and epicLAN and the smaller leagues are RedBull Sphere Wars,
    Talent League, No Expectations R6 League & Sapphire League. Outside of these I have also gained experience in ESL Go4R6 & FACEIT R6TM.
