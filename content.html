    <h2>Me and Content Creation</h2>
    <p>I first started my content creation back in 2015 after finding out about the website Twitch.tv in 2014, I mainly started my time on the website as a viewer, finding new communities to join, watching other content creators play and stream their games, then on my birthday in 2014 I received a Xbox One. <br>
      Finally able to play games with friends I had met during my time on twitch someone had suggested to me to download the Twitch app on the Xbox and share our time playing games. My first stream was 17/08/2015 and I streamed almost daily playing Destiny and Tom Clancy's The Division slowly building my own community. <br>
      In 2015 I got my first ever laptop, it wasn't anything fancy but it allowed me to venture into pc gaming, picking up Counter Strike Global Offensive as my first game on pc and that was it for me, I fell in love with pc gaming but sadly my laptop couldn't run much besides CS:GO so I decided I would start looking into getting my own computer, after saving up and researching I built my first custom gaming computer in 2017 and i've been doing content creation on Twitch ever since, achieving the Twitch Affiliate status on 28/06/2017 now actively reaching for the Twitch Partner goal.
      Over the years I've joined a few organisations as a content creator, travelled for streaming/gaming events around the world and raised money for charities.
